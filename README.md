# evagram

## Getting Started

To get started with running the Evagram application in development mode, clone the JCSDA-internal/evagram repository into your local machine.

### Prerequisites

The Evagram application is a full-stack application comprised of the frontend, backend, and database services that will run and be built inside Docker containers, requiring the installation of Docker into the host system. Please refer to the Docker installation guide for installing Docker onto your OS system.

## Usage

Once Docker is successfully installed into your system, simply open the Docker CLI to build and run the application: `docker compose build` and `docker compose up`. This will automatically build the Evagram application using the docker compose configuration file and click on https://localhost:3000 once the process has started.
